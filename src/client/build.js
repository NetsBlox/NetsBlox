    III. yet to implement
    ---------------------
    - keyboard support for scroll frames and lists
    - full keyboard support for menus (partial support exists)
    - virtual keyboard support for Android and IE


    IV. open issues
    ----------------
    - clipboard support (copy & paste)
    - native (unscaled) high-resolution display support


    V. browser compatibility
    ------------------------
    I have taken great care and considerable effort to make morphic.js
    runnable and appearing exactly the same on all current browsers
    available to me:

    - Firefox for Windows
    - Firefox for Mac
    - Firefox for Android
    - Chrome for Windows
    - Chrome for Mac
    - Chrome for Android
    - Safari for Windows
    - safari for Mac
    - Safari for iOS (mobile)
    - IE for Windows
    - Opera for Windows
    - Opera for Mac


    VI. the big picture
    -------------------
    Morphic.js is completely based on Canvas and JavaScript, it is just
    Morphic, nothing else. Morphic.js is very basic and covers only the
    bare essentials:

        * a stepping mechanism (a time-sharing multiplexer for lively
          user interaction ontop of a single OS/browser thread)
        * progressive display updates (only dirty rectangles are
          redrawn in each display cycle)
        * a tree structure
        * a single World per Canvas element (although you can have
          multiple worlds in multiple Canvas elements on the same web
          page)
        * a single Hand per World (but you can support multi-touch
          events)
        * a single text entry focus per World

    In its current state morphic.js doesn't support Transforms (you
    cannot rotate Morphs), but with PenMorph there already is a simple
    LOGO-like turtle that you can use to draw onto any Morph it is
    attached to. I'm planning to add special Morphs that support these
    operations later on, but not for every Morph in the system.
    Therefore these additions ("sprites" etc.) are likely to be part of
    other libraries ("microworld.js") in separate files.

    the purpose of morphic.js is to provide a malleable framework that
    will let me experiment with lively GUIs for my hobby horse, which
    is drag-and-drop, blocks based programming languages. Those things
    (BYOB4 - http://byob.berkeley.edu) will be written using morphic.js
    as a library.


    VII. programming guide
    ----------------------
    Morphic.js provides a library for lively GUIs inside single HTML
    Canvas elements. Each such canvas element functions as a "world" in
    which other visible shapes ("morphs") can be positioned and
    manipulated, often directly and interactively by the user. Morphs
    are tree nodes and may contain any number of submorphs ("children").

    All things visible in a morphic World are morphs themselves, i.e.
    all text rendering, blinking cursors, entry fields, menus, buttons,
    sliders, windows and dialog boxes etc. are created with morphic.js
    rather than using HTML DOM elements, and as a consequence can be
    changed and adjusted by the programmer regardless of proprietary
    browser behavior.

    Each World has an - invisible - "Hand" resembling the mouse cursor
    (or the user's finger on touch screens) which handles mouse events,
    and may also have a keyboardReceiver to handle key events.

    The basic idea of Morphic is to continuously run display cycles and
    to incrementally update the screen by only redrawing those  World
    regions    which have been "dirtied" since the last redraw. Before
    each shape is processed for redisplay it gets the chance to perform
    a "step" procedure, thus allowing for an illusion of concurrency.


    (1) setting up a web page
    -------------------------
    Setting up a web page for Morphic always involves three steps:
    adding one or more Canvas elements, defining one or more worlds,
    initializing and starting the main loop.


    (a) single world
    -----------------
    Most commonly you will want your World to fill the browsers's whole
    client area. This default situation is easiest and most straight
    forward.

    example html file:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Morphic!</title>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="morphic.js"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript">
                var world;

                window.onload = function () {
                    world = new WorldMorph(
                        document.getElementById('world'));
                    setInterval(loop, 50);
                };

                function loop() {
                    world.doOneCycle();
                }
            </script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <canvas id="world" tabindex="1" width="800" height="600">
                <p>Your browser doesn't support canvas.</p>
            </canvas>
        </body>
    </html>

    if you use ScrollFrames or otherwise plan to support mouse wheel
    scrolling events, you might also add the following inline-CSS
    attribute to the Canvas element:

        style="position: absolute;"

    which will prevent the World to be scrolled around instead of the
    elements inside of it in some browsers.


    (b) multiple worlds
    -------------------
    If you wish to create a web page with more than one world, make
    sure to prevent each world from auto-filling the whole page and
    include    it in the main loop. It's also a good idea to give each
    world its own tabindex:

    example html file:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Morphic!</title>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="morphic.js"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript">
                var world1, world2;

                window.onload = function () {
                    world1 = new WorldMorph(
                        document.getElementById('world1'), false);
                    world2 = new WorldMorph(
                        document.getElementById('world2'), false);
                    setInterval(loop, 50);
                };

                function loop() {
                    world1.doOneCycle();
                    world2.doOneCycle();
                }
            </script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>first world:</p>
            <canvas id="world1" tabindex="1" width="600" height="400">
                <p>Your browser doesn't support canvas.</p>
            </canvas>
            <p>second world:</p>
            <canvas id="world2" tabindex="2" width="400" height="600">
                <p>Your browser doesn't support canvas.</p>
            </canvas>
        </body>
    </html>


    (c) an application
    -------------------
    Of course, most of the time you don't want to just plain use the
    standard Morhic World "as is" out of the box, but write your own
    application (something like Scratch!) in it. For such an
    application you'll create your own morph prototypes, perhaps
    assemble your own "window frame" and bring it all to life in a
    customized World state. the following example creates a simple
    snake-like mouse drawing game.

    example html file:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>touch me!</title>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="morphic.js"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript">
                var worldCanvas, sensor;

                window.onload = function () {
                    var x, y, w, h;

                    worldCanvas = document.getElementById('world');
                    world = new WorldMorph(worldCanvas);
                    world.isDevMode = false;
                    world.color = new Color();

                    w = 100;
                    h = 100;

                    x = 0;
                    y = 0;

                    while ((y * h) < world.height()) {
                        while ((x * w) < world.width()) {
                            sensor = new MouseSensorMorph();
                            sensor.setPosition(new Point(x * w, y * h));
                            sensor.alpha = 0;
                            sensor.setExtent(new Point(w, h));
                            world.add(sensor);
                            x += 1;
                        }
                        x = 0;
                        y += 1;
                    }
                    setInterval(loop, 50);
                };

                function loop() {
                    world.doOneCycle();
                }
            </script>
        </head>
        <body bgcolor='black'>
            <canvas id="world" width="800" height="600">
                <p>Your browser doesn't support canvas.</p>
            </canvas>
        </body>
    </html>

    To get an idea how you can craft your own custom morph prototypes
    I've included two examples which should give you an idea how to add
    properties, override inherited methods and use the stepping
    mechanism for "livelyness":

        BouncerMorph
        MouseSensorMorph

    For the sake of sharing a single file I've included those examples
    in morphic.js itself. Usually you'll define your additions in a
    separate file and keep morphic.js untouched.


    (2) manipulating morphs
    -----------------------
    There are many methods to programmatically manipulate morphs. Among
    the most important and common ones among all morphs are the
    following nine:

    * hide()
    * show()

    * setPosition(aPoint)
    * setExtent(aPoint)
    * setColor(aColor)

    * add(submorph)            - attaches submorph ontop
    * addBack(submorph)        - attaches submorph underneath

    * fullCopy()               - duplication
    * destroy()                - deletion


    (3) events
    ----------
    All user (and system) interaction is triggered by events, which are
    passed on from the root element - the World - to its submorphs. The
    World contains a list of system (browser) events it reacts to in its

        initEventListeners()

    method. Currently there are

        - mouse
        - drop
        - keyboard
        - (window) resize

    events.

    These system events are dispatched within the morphic World by the
    World's Hand and its keyboardReceiver (usually the active text
    cursor).


    (a) mouse events:
    -----------------
    The Hand dispatches the following mouse events to relevant morphs:

        mouseDownLeft
        mouseDownRight
        mouseClickLeft
        mouseClickRight
        mouseDoubleClick
        mouseEnter
        mouseLeave
        mouseEnterDragging
        mouseLeaveDragging
        mouseMove
        mouseScroll

    If you wish your morph to react to any such event, simply add a
    method of the same name as the event, e.g:

        MyMorph.prototype.mouseMove = function(pos) {};

    All of these methods have as optional parameter a Point object
    indicating the current position of the Hand inside the World's
    coordinate system. The

        mouseMove(pos, button)

    event method has an additional optional parameter indicating the
    currently pressed mouse button, which is either 'left' or 'right'.
    You can use this to let users interact with 3D environments.

    Events may be "bubbled" up a morph's owner chain by calling

        this.escalateEvent(functionName, arg)

    in the event handler method's code.

    Likewise, removing the event handler method will render your morph
    passive to the event in question.


    (b) context menu:
    -----------------
    By default right-clicking (or single-finger tap-and-hold) on a morph
    also invokes its context menu (in addition to firing the
    mouseClickRight event). A morph's context menu can be customized by
    assigning a Menu instance to its

        customContextMenu

    property, or altogether suppressed by overriding its inherited

        contextMenu()

    method.


    (c) dragging:
    -------------
    Dragging a morph is initiated when the left mouse button is pressed,
    held and the mouse is moved.

    You can control whether a morph is draggable by setting its

        isDraggable

    property either to false or true. If a morph isn't draggable itself
    it will pass the pick-up request up its owner chain. This lets you
    create draggable composite morphs like Windows, DialogBoxes,
    Sliders etc.

    Sometimes it is desireable to make "template" shapes which cannot be
    moved themselves, but from which instead duplicates can be peeled
    off. This is especially useful for building blocks in construction
    kits, e.g. the MIT-Scratch palette. Morphic.js lets you control this
    functionality by setting the

        isTemplate

    property flag to true for any morph whose "isDraggable" property is
    turned off. When dragging such a Morph the hand will instead grab
    a duplicate of the template whose "isDraggable" flag is true and
    whose "isTemplate" flag is false, in other words: a non-template.

    When creating a copy from a template, the copy's

        reactToTemplateCopy

    is invoked, if it is present.

    Dragging is indicated by adding a drop shadow to the morph in hand.
    If a morph follows the hand without displaying a drop shadow it is
    merely being moved about without changing its parent (owner morph),
    e.g. when "dragging" a morph handle to resize its owner, or when
    "dragging" a slider button.

    Right before a morph is picked up its

        prepareToBeGrabbed(handMorph)

    method is invoked, if it is present. Immediately after the pick-up
    the former parent's

        reactToGrabOf(grabbedMorph)

    method is called, again only if it exists.

    Similar to events, these  methods are optional and don't exist by
    default. For a simple example of how they can be used to adjust
    scroll bars in a scroll frame please have a look at their
    implementation in FrameMorph.


    (d) dropping:
    -------------
    Dropping is triggered when the left mouse button is either pressed
    or released while the Hand is dragging a morph.

    Dropping a morph causes it to become embedded in a new owner morph.
    You can control this embedding behavior by setting the prospective
    drop target's

        acceptsDrops

    property to either true or false, or by overriding its inherited

        wantsDropOf(aMorph)

    method.

    Right after a morph has been dropped its

        justDropped(handMorph)

    method is called, and its new parent's

        reactToDropOf(droppedMorph, handMorph)

    method is invoked, again only if each method exists.

    Similar to events, these  methods are optional and by default are
    not present in morphs by default (watch out for inheritance,
    though!). For a simple example of how they can be used to adjust
    scroll bars in a scroll frame please have a look at their
    implementation in FrameMorph.

    Drops of image elements from outside the world canvas are dispatched as

        droppedImage(aCanvas, name)
        droppedSVG(anImage, name)

    events to interested Morphs at the mouse pointer. If you want you Morph
    to e.g. import outside images you can add the droppedImage() and / or the
    droppedSVG() methods to it. The parameter passed to the event handles is
    a new offscreen canvas element representing a copy of the original image
    element which can be directly used, e.g. by assigning it to another
    Morph's image property. In the case of a dropped SVG it is an image
    element (not a canvas), which has to be rasterized onto a canvas before
    it can be used. The benefit of handling SVGs as image elements is that
    rasterization can be deferred until the destination scale is known, taking
    advantage of SVG's ability for smooth scaling. If instead SVGs are to be
    rasterized right away, you can set the

        MorphicPreferences.rasterizeSVGs

    preference to <true>. In this case dropped SVGs also trigger the
    droppedImage() event with a canvas containing a rasterized version of the
    SVG.

    The same applies to drops of audio or text files from outside the world
    canvas.

    Those are dispatched as

        droppedAudio(anAudio, name)
        droppedText(aString, name)

    events to interested Morphs at the mouse pointer.

    if none of the above content types can be determined, the file contents
    is dispatched as an ArrayBuffer to interested Morphs:

        droppedBinary(anArrayBuffer, name)


    (e) keyboard events
    -------------------
    The World dispatches the following key events to its active
    keyboardReceiver:

        keypress
        keydown
        keyup

    Currently the only morph which acts as keyboard receiver is
    CursorMorph, the basic text editing widget. If you wish to add
    keyboard support to your morph you need to add event handling
    methods for

        processKeyPress(event)
        processKeyDown(event)
        processKeyUp(event)

    and activate them by assigning your morph to the World's

        keyboardReceiver

    property.

    Note that processKeyUp() is optional and doesn't have to be present
    if your morph doesn't require it.


    (f) resize event
    ----------------
    The Window resize event is handled by the World and allows the
    World's extent to be adjusted so that it always completely fills
    the browser's visible page. You can turn off this default behavior
    by setting the World's

        useFillPage

    property to false.

    Alternatively you can also initialize the World with the
    useFillPage switch turned off from the beginning by passing the
    false value as second parameter to the World's constructor:

        world = new World(aCanvas, false);

    Use this when creating a web page with multiple Worlds.

    if "useFillPage" is turned on the World dispatches an

        reactToWorldResize(newBounds)

    events to all of its children (toplevel only), allowing each to
    adjust to the new World bounds by implementing a corresponding
    method, the passed argument being the World's new dimensions after
    completing the resize. By default, the "reactToWorldResize" Method
    does not exist.

    Example:

    Add the following method to your Morph to let it automatically
    fill the whole World, but leave a 10 pixel border uncovered:

        MyMorph.prototype.reactToWorldResize = function (rect) {
            this.changed();
            this.bounds = rect.insetBy(10);
            this.drawNew();
            this.changed();
        };


    (g) combined mouse-keyboard events
    ----------------------------------
    Occasionally you'll want an object to react differently to a mouse
    click or to some other mouse event while the user holds down a key
    on the keyboard. Such "shift-click", "ctl-click", or "alt-click"
    events can be implemented by querying the World's

        currentKey

    property inside the function that reacts to the mouse event. This
    property stores the keyCode of the key that's currently pressed.
    Once the key is released by the user it reverts to null.


    (h) text editing events
    -----------------------
    Much of Morphic's "liveliness" comes out of allowing text elements
    (instances of either single-lined StringMorph or multi-lined TextMorph)
    to be directly manipulated and edited by users. This requires other
    objects which may have an interest in the text element's state to react
    appropriately. Therefore text elements and their manipulators emit
    a stream of events, mostly by "bubbling" them up the text element's
    owner chain. Text elements' parents are notified about the following
    events:

    Whenever the user presses a key on the keyboard while a text element
    is being edited, a

        reactToKeystroke(event)

    is escalated up its parent chain, the "event" parameter being the
    original one received by the World.

    Once the user has completed the edit, the following events are
    dispatched:

        accept() - <enter> was pressed on a single line of text
        cancel() - <esc> was pressed on any text element

    Note that "accept" only gets triggered by single-line texte elements,
    as the <enter> key is used to insert line breaks in multi-line
    elements. Therefore, whenever a text edit is terminated by the user
    (accepted, cancelled or otherwise),

        reactToEdit(StringOrTextMorph)

    is triggered.

    If the MorphicPreference's

        useSliderForInput

    setting is turned on, a slider is popped up underneath the currently
    edited text element letting the user insert numbers out of the given
    slider range. Whenever this happens, i.e. whenever the slider is moved
    or while the slider button is pressed, a stream of

        reactToSliderEdit(StringOrTextMorph)

    events is dispatched, allowing for "Bret-Victor" style "live coding"
    applications.

    In addition to user-initiated events text elements also emit
    change notifications to their direct parents whenever their drawNew()
    method is invoked. That way complex Morphs containing text elements
    get a chance to react if something about the embedded text has been
    modified programmatically. These events are:

        layoutChanged() - sent from instances of TextMorph
        fixLayout() - sent from instances of StringMorph

    they are different so that Morphs which contain both multi-line and
    single-line text elements can hold them apart.


    (4) stepping
    ------------
    Stepping is what makes Morphic "magical". Two properties control
    a morph's stepping behavior: the fps attribute and the step()
    method.

    By default the

        step()

    method does nothing. As you can see in the examples of BouncerMorph
    and MouseSensorMorph you can easily override this inherited method
    to suit your needs.

    By default the step() method is called once per display cycle.
    Depending on the number of actively stepping morphs and the
    complexity of your step() methods this can cause quite a strain on
    your CPU, and also result in your application behaving differently
    on slower computers than on fast ones.

    setting

        myMorph.fps

    to a number lower than the interval for the main loop lets you free
    system resources (albeit at the cost of a less responsive or slower
    behavior for this particular morph).


    (5) creating new kinds of morphs
    --------------------------------
    The real fun begins when you start to create new kinds of morphs
    with customized shapes. Imagine, e.g. jigsaw puzzle pieces or
    musical notes. For this you have to override the default

        drawNew()

    method.

    This method creates a new offscreen Canvas and stores it in
    the morph's

        image

    property.

    Use the following template for a start:

        MyMorph.prototype.drawNew = function() {
            var context;
            this.image = newCanvas(this.extent());
            context = this.image.getContext('2d');
            // use context to paint stuff here
        };

    If your new morph stores or references to other morphs outside of
    the submorph tree in other properties, be sure to also override the
    default

        updateReferences()

    method if you want it to support duplication.


    (6) development and user modes
    ------------------------------
    When working with Squeak on Scratch or BYOB among the features I
    like the best and use the most is inspecting what's going on in
    the World while it is up and running. That's what development mode
    is for (you could also call it debug mode). In essence development
    mode controls which context menu shows up. In user mode right
    clicking (or double finger tapping) a morph invokes its

        customContextMenu

    property, whereas in development mode only the general

        developersMenu()

    method is called and the resulting menu invoked. The developers'
    menu features Gui-Builder-wise functionality to directly inspect,
    take apart, reassamble and otherwise manipulate morphs and their
    contents.

    Instead of using the "customContextMenu" property you can also
    assign a more dynamic contextMenu by overriding the general

        userMenu()

    method with a customized menu constructor. The difference between
    the customContextMenu property and the userMenu() method is that
    the former is also present in development mode and overrides the
    developersMenu() result. For an example of how to use the
    customContextMenu property have a look at TextMorph's evaluation
    menu, which is used for the Inspector's evaluation pane.

    When in development mode you can inspect every Morph's properties
    with the inspector, including all of its methods. The inspector
    also lets you add, remove and rename properties, and even edit
    their values at runtime. Like in a Smalltalk environment the inspect
    features an evaluation pane into which you can type in arbitrary
    JavaScript code and evaluate it in the context of the inspectee.

    Use switching between user and development modes while you are
    developing an application and disable switching to development once
    you're done and deploying, because generally you don't want to
    confuse end-users with inspectors and meta-level stuff.


    (7) turtle graphics
    -------------------

    The basic Morphic kernel features a simple LOGO turtle constructor
    called

        PenMorph

    which you can use to draw onto its parent Morph. By default every
    Morph in the system (including the World) is able to act as turtle
    canvas and can display pen trails. Pen trails will be lost whenever
    the trails morph (the pen's parent) performs a "drawNew()"
    operation. If you want to create your own pen trails canvas, you
    may wish to modify its

        penTrails()

    property, so that it keeps a separate offscreen canvas for pen
    trails (and doesn't loose these on redraw).

    the following properties of PenMorph are relevant for turtle
    graphics:

        color        - a Color
        size        - line width of pen trails
        heading        - degrees
        isDown        - drawing state

    the following commands can be used to actually draw something:

        up()        - lift the pen up, further movements leave no trails
        down()        - set down, further movements leave trails
        clear()        - remove all trails from the current parent
        forward(n)    - move n steps in the current direction (heading)
        turn(n)        - turn right n degrees

    Turtle graphics can best be explored interactively by creating a
    new PenMorph object and by manipulating it with the inspector
    widget.

    NOTE: PenMorph has a special optimization for recursive operations
    called

        warp(function)

    You can significantly speed up recursive ops and increase the depth
    of recursion that's displayable by wrapping WARP around your
    recursive function call:

    example:

        myPen.warp(function () {
            myPen.tree(12, 120, 20);
        })

    will be much faster than just invoking the tree function, because it
    prevents the parent's parent from keeping track of every single line
    segment and instead redraws the outcome in a single pass.


    (8) damage list housekeeping
    ----------------------------
    Morphic's progressive display update comes at the cost of having to
    cycle through a list of "broken rectangles" every display cycle. If
    this list gets very long working this damage list can lead to a
    seemingly dramatic slow-down of the Morphic system. Typically this
    occurs when updating the layout of complex Morphs with very many
    submorphs, e.g. when resizing an inspector window.

    An effective strategy to cope with this is to use the inherited

        trackChanges

    property of the Morph prototype for damage list housekeeping.

    The trackChanges property of the Morph prototype is a Boolean switch
    that determines whether the World's damage list ('broken' rectangles)
    tracks changes. By default the switch is always on. If set to false
    changes are not stored. This can be very useful for housekeeping of
    the damage list in situations where a large number of (sub-) morphs
    are changed more or less at once. Instead of keeping track of every
    single submorph's changes tremendous performance improvements can be
    achieved by setting the trackChanges flag to false before propagating
    the layout changes, setting it to true again and then storing the full
    bounds of the surrounding morph. An an example refer to the

        moveBy()

    method of HandMorph, and to the

        fixLayout()

    method of InspectorMorph, or the

        startLayout()
        endLayout()

    methods of SyntaxElementMorph in the Snap application.


    (9) minifying morphic.js
    ------------------------
    Coming from Smalltalk and being a Squeaker at heart I am a huge fan
    of browsing the code itself to make sense of it. Therefore I have
    included this documentation and (too little) inline comments so all
    you need to get going is this very file.

    Nowadays with live streaming HD video even on mobile phones 250 KB
    shouldn't be a big strain on bandwith, still minifying and even
    compressing morphic.js down do about 100 KB may sometimes improve
    performance in production use.

    Being an attorney-at-law myself you programmer folk keep harassing
    me with rabulistic nitpickings about free software licenses. I'm
    releasing morphic.js under an AGPL license. Therefore please make
    sure to adhere to that license in any minified or compressed version.


    VIII. acknowledgements
    ----------------------
    The original Morphic was designed and written by Randy Smith and
    John Maloney for the SELF programming language, and later ported to
    Squeak (Smalltalk) by John Maloney and Dan Ingalls, who has also
    ported it to JavaScript (the Lively Kernel), once again setting
    a "Gold Standard" for self sustaining systems which morphic.js
    cannot and does not aspire to meet.

    This Morphic implementation for JavaScript is not a direct port of
    Squeak's Morphic, but still many individual functions have been
    ported almost literally from Squeak, sometimes even including their
    comments, e.g. the morph duplication mechanism fullCopy(). Squeak
    has been a treasure trove, and if morphic.js looks, feels and
    smells a lot like Squeak, I'll take it as a compliment.

    Evelyn Eastmond has inspired and encouraged me with her wonderful
    implementation of DesignBlocksJS. Thanks for sharing code, ideas
    and enthusiasm for programming.

    John Maloney has been my mentor and my source of inspiration for
    these Morphic experiments. Thanks for the critique, the suggestions
    and explanations for all things Morphic and for being my all time
    programming hero.

    I have originally written morphic.js in Florian Balmer's Notepad2
    editor for Windows, later switched to Apple's Dashcode and later
    still to Apple's Xcode. I've also come to depend on both Douglas
    Crockford's JSLint, Mozilla's Firebug and Google's Chrome to get
    it right.

/*
    damage list housekeeping

    the trackChanges property of the Morph prototype is a Boolean switch
    that determines whether the World's damage list ('broken' rectangles)
    tracks changes. By default the switch is always on. If set to false
    changes are not stored. This can be very useful for housekeeping of
    the damage list in situations where a large number of (sub-) morphs
    are changed more or less at once. Instead of keeping track of every
    single submorph's changes tremendous performance improvements can be
    achieved by setting the trackChanges flag to false before propagating
    the layout changes, setting it to true again and then storing the full
    bounds of the surrounding morph. An an example refer to the

        fixLayout()

    method of InspectorMorph, or the

        startLayout()
        endLayout()

    methods of SyntaxElementMorph in the Snap application.

    Note: for some strange reason this method works fine if the page is

    (e.g. from a directory), in which case it's always null.

    This behavior is consistent throughout several browsers. I have no
    clue what's behind this, apparently the imageData attribute of
    canvas context only gets filled with meaningful data if transferred
    via HTTP ???

    This is somewhat of a showstopper for color detection in a planned
    offline version of Snap.

    The issue has also been discussed at: (join lines before pasting)

    structure of syntax elements
    ----------------------------
    the structure of syntax elements is identical with their morphic
    tree. There are, however, accessor methods to get (only) the
    parts which are relevant for evaluation wherever appropriate.

    In Scratch/BYOB every sprite and the stage has its own "blocks bin",
    an instance of ScriptsMorph (we're going to name it differently in
    Snap, probably just "scripts").

    At the top most level blocks are assembled into stacks in ScriptsMorph
    instances. A ScriptsMorph contains nothing but blocks, therefore
    every child of a ScriptsMorph is expected to be a block.

    Each block contains:

        selector    - indicating the name of the function it triggers,

    Its arguments are first evaluated and then passed along    as the
    selector is called. Arguments can be either instances of ArgMorph
    or ReporterBlockMorph. The getter method for a block's arguments is

        inputs()    - gets an array of arg morphs and/or reporter blocks

    in addition to inputs, command blocks also know their

        nextBlock()    - gets the block attached to the receiver's bottom

    and the block they're attached to - if any: Their parent.

    please also refer to the high-level comment at the beginning of each
    constructor for further details.

/*
    the following settings govern the appearance of all syntax elements
    (blocks and slots) where applicable:

    outline:

        corner        - radius of command block rounding
        rounding    - radius of reporter block rounding
        edge        - width of 3D-ish shading box
        hatHeight    - additional top space for hat blocks
        hatWidth    - minimum width for hat blocks
        rfBorder    - pixel width of reification border (grey outline)
        minWidth    - minimum width for any syntax element's contents

    jigsaw shape:

        inset        - distance from indentation to left edge
        dent        - width of indentation bottom

    paddings:

        bottomPadding    - adds to the width of the bottom most c-slot
        cSlotPadding    - adds to the width of the open "C" in c-slots
        typeInPadding    - adds pixels between text and edge in input slots
        labelPadding    - adds left/right pixels to block labels

    label:

        labelFontName    - <string> specific font family name
        labelFontStyle    - <string> generic font family name, cascaded
        fontSize        - duh
        embossing        - <Point> offset for embossing effect
        labelWidth        - column width, used for word wrapping
        labelWordWrap    - <bool> if true labels can break after each word
        dynamicInputLabels - <bool> if true inputs can have dynamic labels

    snapping:

        feedbackColor        - <Color> for displaying drop feedbacks
        feedbackMinHeight    - height of white line for command block snaps
        minSnapDistance        - threshold when commands start snapping
        reporterDropFeedbackPadding    - increases reporter drop feedback

    color gradients:

        contrast        - <percent int> 3D-ish shading gradient contrast
        labelContrast    - <percent int> 3D-ish label shading contrast
        activeHighlight    - <Color> for stack highlighting when active
        errorHighlight    - <Color> for error highlighting
        activeBlur        - <pixels int> shadow for blurred activeHighlight
        activeBorder    - <pixels int> unblurred activeHighlight
        rfColor            - <Color> for reified outlines and slot backgrounds

// BlockMorph //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/*
    I am an abstraction of all blocks (commands, reporters, hats).

    Aside from the visual settings inherited from Morph and
    SyntaxElementMorph my most important attributes and public
    accessors are:

    selector    - (string) name of method to be triggered
    receiver()    - answer the object (sprite) to which I apply
    inputs()    - answer an array with my arg slots and nested reporters
    defaults    - an optional Array containing default input values
    topBlock()    - answer the top block of the stack I'm attached to
    blockSpec    - a formalized description of my label parts
    setSpec()    - force me to change my label structure
    evaluate()    - answer the result of my evaluation
    isUnevaluated() - answer whether I am part of a special form

    Zebra coloring provides a mechanism to alternate brightness of nested,
    same colored blocks (of the same category). The deviation of alternating
    brightness is set in the preferences setting:

    zebraContrast - <number> percentage of brightness deviation

    attribute. If the attribute is set to zero, zebra coloring is turned
    off. If it is a positive number, nested blocks will be colored in
    a brighter shade of the same hue and the label color (for texts)
    alternates between white and black. If the attribute is set to a negative
    number, nested blocks are colored in a darker shade of the same hue
    with no alternating label colors.

    Note: Some of these methods are inherited from SyntaxElementMorph
    for technical reasons, because they are shared among Block and
    MultiArgMorph (e.g. topBlock()).

    blockSpec is a formatted string consisting of plain words and
    reserved words starting with the percent character (%), which
    represent the following pre-defined input slots and/or label
    features:

    arity: single

    %br        - user-forced line break
    %s        - white rectangular type-in slot ("string-type")
    %txt    - white rectangular type-in slot ("text-type")
    %mlt    - white rectangular type-in slot ("multi-line-text-type")
    %code    - white rectangular type-in slot, monospaced font
    %n        - white roundish type-in slot ("numerical")
    %dir    - white roundish type-in slot with drop-down for directions
    %inst    - white roundish type-in slot with drop-down for instruments
    %ida    - white roundish type-in slot with drop-down for list indices
    %idx    - white roundish type-in slot for indices incl. "any"
    %obj    - specially drawn slot for object reporters
    %spr    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for object-names
    %col    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for collidables
    %dst    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for distances
    %cst    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for costume-names
    %eff    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for graphic effects
    %snd    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for sound names
    %key    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for keyboard keys
    %msg    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for messages
    %att    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for attributes
    %fun    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for math functions
    %typ    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for data types
    %var    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for variable names
    %shd    - Chameleon colored rectuangular drop-down for shadowed var names
    %lst    - chameleon colored rectangular drop-down for list names
    %b        - chameleon colored hexagonal slot (for predicates)
    %l        - list icon
    %c        - C-shaped command slot
    %clr    - interactive color slot
    %t        - inline variable reporter template
    %anyUE    - white rectangular type-in slot, unevaluated if replaced
    %boolUE    - chameleon colored hexagonal slot, unevaluated if replaced
    %f        - round function slot, unevaluated if replaced,
    %r        - round reporter slot
    %p        - hexagonal predicate slot

    rings:

    %cmdRing    - command slotted ring with %ringparms
    %repRing    - round slotted ringn with %ringparms
    %predRing   - diamond slotted ring with %ringparms

    arity: multiple

    %mult%x    - where %x stands for any of the above single inputs
    %inputs - for an additional text label 'with inputs'
    %words - for an expandable list of default 2 (used in JOIN)
    %exp - for a static expandable list of minimum 0 (used in LIST)
    %scriptVars - for an expandable list of variable reporter templates
    %parms - for an expandable list of formal parameters
    %ringparms - the same for use inside Rings

    special form: upvar

    %upvar - same as %t (inline variable reporter template)

    special form: input name

    %inputName - variable blob (used in input type dialog)

    examples:

        'if %b %c else %c'        - creates Scratch's If/Else block
        'set pen color to %clr'    - creates Scratch's Pen color block
        'list %mult%s'            - creates BYOB's list reporter block
        'call %n %inputs'        - creates BYOB's Call block
        'the script %parms %c'    - creates BYOB's THE SCRIPT block

/*
    I am an editable text input slot. I can be either rectangular or
    rounded, and can have an optional drop-down menu. If I'm set to
    read-only I must have a drop-down menu and will assume a darker
    shade of my parent's color.

    my most important public attributes and accessors are:

    setContents(str/float)    - display the argument (string or float)
    contents().text            - get the displayed string
    choices                    - a key/value list for my optional drop-down
    isReadOnly                - governs whether I am editable or not
    isNumeric                - governs my outer shape (round or rect)

    my block specs are:

    %s        - string input, rectangular
    %n        - numerical input, semi-circular vertical edges
    %anyUE    - any unevaluated

    evaluate() returns my displayed string, cast to float if I'm numerical

    there are also a number of specialized drop-down menu presets, refer
    to BlockMorph for details.

    I offer keyboard navigation for syntax elements, blocks and scripts:

    activate:
      - shift + click on a scripting pane's background
      - shift + click on any block
      - shift + enter in the IDE's edit mode

    stop editing:
      - left-click on scripting pane's background
      - esc

    navigate among scripts:
      - tab: next script
      - backtab (shift + tab): last script

    start editing a new script:
      - shift + enter

    navigate among commands within a script:
      - down arrow: next command
      - up arrow: last command

    navigate among all elements within a script:
      - right arrow: next element (block or input)
      - left arrow: last element

    move the currently edited script (stack of blocks):
      - shift + arrow keys (left, right, up, down)

    editing scripts:

      - backspace:
        * delete currently focused reporter
        * delete command above current insertion mark (blinking)
        * collapse currently focused variadic input by one element

      - enter:
        * edit currently focused input slot
        * expand currently focused variadic input by one element

      - space:
        * activate currently focused input slot's pull-down menu, if any
        * show a menu of reachable variables for the focused input or reporter

      - any other key:
        start searching for insertable matching blocks

      - in menus triggered by this feature:
        * navigate with up / down arrow keys
        * trigger selection with enter
        * cancel menu with esc

      - in the search bar triggered b this feature:
        * keep typing / deleting to narrow and update matches
        * navigate among shown matches with up / down arrow keys
        * insert selected match at the focus' position with enter
        * cancel searching and inserting with esc

    running the currently edited script:
        * shift+ctrl+enter simulates clicking the edited script with the mouse

// Process /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/*
    A Process is what brings a stack of blocks to life. The process
    keeps track of which block to run next, evaluates block arguments,
    handles control structures, and so forth.

    The ThreadManager is the (passive) scheduler, telling each process
    when to run by calling its runStep() method. The runStep() method
    will execute some number of blocks, then voluntarily yield control
    so that the ThreadManager can run another process.

    The Scratch etiquette is that a process should yield control at the
    end of every loop iteration, and while it is running a timed command
    (e.g. "wait 5 secs") or a synchronous command (e.g. "broadcast xxx
    and wait"). Since Snap also has lambda and custom blocks Snap adds
    yields at the beginning of each non-atomic custom command block
    execution, and - to let users escape infinite loops and recursion -
    whenever the process runs into a timeout.

    a Process runs for a receiver, i.e. a sprite or the stage or any
    blocks-scriptable object that we'll introduce.

    structure:

    topBlock            the stack's first block, of which all others
                        are children
    receiver            object (sprite) to which the process applies,
                        cached from the top block
    context             the Context describing the current state
                        of this process
    homeContext         stores information relevant to the whole process,
                        i.e. its receiver, result etc.
    isPaused            boolean indicating whether to pause
    readyToYield        boolean indicating whether to yield control to
                        another process
    readyToTerminate    boolean indicating whether the stop method has
                        been called
    isDead              boolean indicating a terminated clone process
    timeout             msecs after which to force yield
    lastYield           msecs when the process last yielded
    errorFlag           boolean indicating whether an error was encountered
    prompter            active instance of StagePrompterMorph
    httpRequest         active instance of an HttpRequest or null
    pauseOffset         msecs between the start of an interpolated operation
                        and when the process was paused
    exportResult        boolean flag indicating whether a picture of the top
                        block along with the result bubble shoud be exported
    onComplete          an optional callback function to be executed when
                        the process is done
    procedureCount      number counting procedure call entries,
                        used to tag custom block calls, so "stop block"
                        invocations can catch them

--------------------------------------
Caution: we cannot just revert to this version of the method, because to make
tail call elimination work many tweaks had to be done to various primitives.
For the most part these tweaks are about schlepping the outer context (for
the variable bindings) and the isCustomBlock flag along, and are indicated
by a short comment in the code. But to really revert would take a good measure
of trial and error as well as debugging. In the developers file archive there
is a version of threads.js dated 120119(2) which basically resembles the
last version before introducing tail call optimization on 120123.

    Nathan Dinsmore contributed a fully working prototype,
    Nathan's brilliant flood-fill tool has been more or less
    directly imported into this paint implementation.

    Jens Mönig has contributed icons and bugfixes and says he has probably
    introduced many other bugs in that process. :-)

    I am a dynamic array data structure for SNAP!
    My index starts with 1

    I am a "smart" hybrid list, because I can be used as both a linked
    list and as a dynamic array

    public interface:

    setters (linked):
    -----------------
    cons                - answer a new list with the given item in front
    cdr                    - answer all but the first element

    setters (arrayed):
    ------------------
    add(element, index)    - insert the element before the given slot,
    put(element, index)    - overwrite the element at the given slot
    remove(index)        - remove the given slot, shortening the list
    clear()                - remove all elements

    getters (all hybrid):
    ---------------------
    length()            - number of slots
    at(index)            - element present in specified slot
    contains(element)    - <bool>

    conversion:
    -----------
    asArray()            - answer me as JavaScript array
    asText()            - answer my elements (recursively) concatenated

    Nathan Dinsmore contributed to the design and implemented a first
    working version of a complete XMLSerializer. I have taken much of the
    overall design and many of the functions and methods in this file from
    Nathan's fine original prototype. Recently Nathan has once again
    worked his magic on the parser and optimized it by an order of
    magnitude.

    Nathan Dinsmore contributed to the design and implemented a first
    working version of a complete XMLSerializer. I have taken much of the
    overall design and many of the functions and methods in this file from
    Nathan's fine original prototype.
